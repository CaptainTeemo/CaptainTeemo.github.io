Reasons crashing an app could be varied, but there's one really annoying is something like:

>*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSRangeException', reason: '*** -[__NSArrayI objectAtIndex:]: index i beyond bounds [0 .. i - 1]'

### Excuse me?

One might say, why don't you do `bounds checking` every time you need to access an array by index?

Well, that's ok, totally ok.

So that's all, end of story.

**A man must figure out an awesome way to do bounds checking.**

The **basic idea** is check if that index is greater or equal than array size or not when accessing value by index. If so, return nil.

As for `NSArray`, we use `[NSArray objectAtIndex:]` or `NSArray[index]` to work, bounds checking should be done in these two methods apparently.

The **inheritance approaching** was banned at a very first moment, a man cannot break existence code structure when adding new features.

Then here comes the choice: `extension(aka category)`.

### First Try

A man creates an extension which uses runtime functions to swizzle `objectAtIndex:`, and do bounds checking before returning the value.

```objc
@interface NSArray<ObjectType> (BoundsChecking)
@end

@implementation NSArray (BoundsChecking)
+ (void)load {
    static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
    dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{
        [NSArray replaceSelector:@selector(objectAtIndex:) withNew:@selector(ex_objectAtIndex:)];
    });
}

+ (void)replaceSelector:(SEL)selector withNew:(SEL)newSelector {
    Method original = class_getInstanceMethod([self class], selector);
    Method swizzled = class_getInstanceMethod([self class], newSelector);

    method_exchangeImplementations(original, swizzled);
}

- (id)ex_objectAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index {
    if (index >= self.count) {
        return nil;
    }
    return [self ex_objectAtIndex:index];
}

@end
```

A man also wrote a test

```objc
    NSArray *array = @[@1, @2, @3, @4, @5];
    NSLog(@"%@", array[0]);
    NSLog(@"%@", array[5]);
```

cmd + R

Oops, an exception has been thrown!

It said `[NSArray objectAtIndex:] method only defined for abstract class`.

What the problem here is that `NSArray` is a kind of so called `Class Cluster`, swizzle or override methods in primitive class should be atomic, which means override them all or none.

### Try Again

Since primitive class methods cannot be overridden in `NSArray`, is there any chance to override one in an extension?

From to [Apple's Document](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/CustomizingExistingClasses/CustomizingExistingClasses.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011210-CH6-SW4)

>Because the methods declared in a category are added to an existing class, you need to be very careful about method names.

>**If the name of a method declared in a category is the same as a method in the original class, or a method in another category on the same class (or even a superclass), the behavior is undefined as to which method implementation is used at runtime.** This is less likely to be an issue if youâ€™re using categories with your own classes, but can cause problems when using categories to add methods to standard Cocoa or Cocoa Touch classes.

So the answer is **better not**.

### Finally

A man has never given up.

After browsing the header of `NSArray` for a little while, there is a method called `objectAtIndexedSubscript:`, and it's in another extension.

Well, this is the one.

Since the method `objectAtIndex:` in primitive class could not be overridden, a man has to create a another one let's call it `tryGetObjectAtIndex:` instead, and fill with the bounds checking logic.

```objc
- (id)tryGetObjectAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index {
    if (index >= self.count) {
        return nil;
    }
    return [self objectAtIndex:index];
}
```

So the final code is

```objc
@interface NSArray<ObjectType> (BoundsChecking)
- (nullable ObjectType)tryGetObjectAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index;
@end

@implementation NSArray (BoundsChecking)

+ (void)load {
    static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
    dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{
        [NSArray replaceSelector:@selector(objectAtIndexedSubscript:) withNew:@selector(ex_objectAtIndexedSubscript:)];
    });
}

+ (void)replaceSelector:(SEL)selector withNew:(SEL)newSelector {
    Method original = class_getInstanceMethod([self class], selector);
    Method swizzled = class_getInstanceMethod([self class], newSelector);

    method_exchangeImplementations(original, swizzled);
}

- (id)tryGetObjectAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index {
    if (index >= self.count) {
        return nil;
    }
    return [self objectAtIndex:index];
}

- (id)ex_objectAtIndexedSubscript:(NSUInteger)index {
    return [self tryGetObjectAtIndex:index];
}

@end
```

>Note that only the literal approaching added bounds checking, for `objectAtIndex:`, replace it with literal style or use `tryGetObjectAtIndex:`

Now let's run the test:

```objc
1
(null)
```

No more crashes.
